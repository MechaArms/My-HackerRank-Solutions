//My Solution
//===========

fun camelcase(s: String): Int {
    var count: Int = 1
    for (i in s){
        if (i == i.toUpperCase()){
            count ++
        }
    }
    return count
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val s = readLine()!!

    val result = camelcase(s)

    println(result)
}

//Best Solution
//=============

fun camelcase(s: String): Int {
     return 1 + s.count { it.isUpperCase() }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val s = readLine()!!

    val result = camelcase(s)

    println(result)
}
